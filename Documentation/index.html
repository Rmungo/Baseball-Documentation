                <p>
                    The object of baseball is to score more runs than your
                    opponent. The idea is to hit the ball thrown at you as far
                    as you can before running around 4 bases to complete a run.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a player manages to get around the four bases before
                    being tagged out, then another batter steps in.
                </p>
                <code
                    >A game is played out between two teams, each made up of 9
                    players. The game lasts for 9 innings with each team
                    alternating between batting and fielding in each
                    inning</code

                <p>
                    The scores at the end of the innings are added to a
                    cumulative score and the team with most points wins. Each
                    team has three outs per inning before they then swap roles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each inning can be broken down into the top (where the away
                    team bats), and the bottom (where the home team bats).
                </p>
                <code
                    >The field is split into two sections: infield and outfield.
                    Separating the infield and outfield is a diamond shape with
                    four bases, spaced at 90 feet apart each.</code

                <h2>Scoring</h2>
                <p>
                    To score, a batter must hit the ball with the bat into the
                    designated fielding area and make it around all four bases
                    (before the fielding team is able to collect the ball and
                    throw it to the base the batter is running to).
                </p>
                <p>
                    A player can score a mandatory point if they hit a home run,
                    which usually means the ball has left the playing area,
                    often landing in the crowd. A player can stop at any base if
                    they feel they might not make it to the next base before
                    being tagged out.
                </p>
                <code
                    >Players can score multiple points from one hit if more than
                    one player is already on one of the bases. When you hear the
                    phrase 'the bases are loaded', this refers to the instance
                    where there is a player on every base.</code

                    To win a game, you must outscore your opposition through the
                    9 innings played.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The team with the most points after 9 innings is deemed the
                    winner.

                    Baeball is an ever evolving game and has had many origins
                    and changes throughout its evolution
                </p>
                <p>
                    Baseball rule changes has taken baseball from a local
                    pastime, to the international sport it is today.
                </p>
                <code
                    >The current iteration of baseball's rules are as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The fielding team’s positions are made up of a
                            pitcher, catcher, first baseman, second baseman,
                            shortstop, third baseman, and three outfielders at
                            left field, centre field and right field.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once a batting order is picked, then it cannot be
                            changed throughout the game. Substitutes are
                            permitted, however, they must bat in the order of
                            the previous player whom they replaced.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the batter manages to hit the ball from the
                            pitcher, they must make an effort to at least get to
                            first base. They can then run to as many bases as
                            they wish before being tagged out. Each base must be
                            touched with some part of the batters body when
                            running past.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A batter gets up to three strikes before getting
                            out. A strike is deemed when a batter swings for a
                            ball and misses it. The batter can leave the ball
                            but, if it’s within a certain area (called the
                            'strike zone'), then a strike will also be given. If
                            four balls miss the strike zone and the batter does
                            not swing their bat, they can walk to first base.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Players can be dismissed by either a 'strike out'
                            (referring to a batsman missing the ball three
                            times), 'force out' (when a player fails to make the
                            base before the defensive player), 'fly out' (when
                            the ball is hit in the air and caught without it
                            bouncing), and 'tag outs' (where a defensive player
                            with the ball tags the batsman with the ball all
                            whilst they are running).
                        </li>
